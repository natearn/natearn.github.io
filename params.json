  "body": "### Introduction\r\nThe natearn project aims to produce a project contributer who is adaptive to a rapidly changing software ecosystem by being easily configurable and productive with very little overhead. You might even say that I want natearn to be an autonomous code-generating machine that can handle any task.\r\n\r\nThe guiding principles of natearn are minimalism, collaboration, and critical analysis. As a result of this, natearn works well in agile environments. \r\n\r\n### Features\r\nnatearn already comes with a huge set of features. With virtually no extra training, natearn can produce professional-quality software in any of the following languages:\r\n* JavaScript\r\n* C\r\n* C++\r\n* Ruby\r\n* Haskell\r\n* and more!\r\n\r\nnatearn also has the following integrations:\r\n* HTML & CSS\r\n* ReactJS\r\n* Rails\r\n* Yesod\r\n* Git\r\n* Docker\r\n* Vagrant\r\n* OAuth2\r\n\r\n### Goals\r\nI feel that natearn is very close to being a completely autonomous full-stack developer. So I've decided to focus on improvements that will fill the gaps in natearn's full-stack capabilities. I'm currently working on expanding natearn to support more web frameworks and tools. natearn also needs a better online presence; I've been able to put a bit of time towards that lately, but it's not enough. \r\n\r\n### Contributing\r\nThis will be information about how to contribute. Maybe you could offer to employ natearn at your company; or you could donate to support natearn's next lunch. There are lots of ways to contribute!\r\n\r\n### Why natearn?\r\nWe aren't gonna lie here: natearn is a serious contender. For what? Well, that is a question. Just know that natearn is a great project contributor; better than you ever imagined before reading this section.\r\n\r\n### Contact\r\nYou can contact the development team directly at natearn@natearn.info. natearn is also on LinkedIn.",
