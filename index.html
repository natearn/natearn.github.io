		<section id="introduction">
			<p>Hello there, welcome! I'm Nathan. This page is about me.</p>
			<p>Professionally, I am a mathematician with several years of software development experience. I have a bachelor's degree in computer science from a prestigious, Canadian university. I have worked in small start-ups as well as larger companies, worked independently and in teams, and have been solely responsible for client-facing projects.</p>
			<p>More personally, I am an ever-curious explorer who is always seeking to better himself. I took a hiatus from IT nearly 2 years ago to explore the world and hopefully learn how to live better. I am now a self-taught musician, and backpacker. I love strategy games, film, and cooking.</p>
			<p>I am currently looking for software work either remotely or in Berlin.</p>

				<p>I was responsible for creating the indoor map interfaces (client-side browser app). A big challenge we faced was offline data availability, where we used a combination of solutions including local storage and cache headers. I facilitated the transition of our maps platform to Reactjs and contributed to other internal tools with the purpose of improving reliability and reusability of code.</p>

				<p>I contributed features to multiple Ruby on Rails projects. The team was small and agile (SCRUM), working in pairs. My partner and I would meet with clients and other stakeholders, organise weekly sprints, and execute on them.</p>

				<p>I was able to help the founders develop their initial product. My role was to write web-scraping scripts to build a large database of academics and experts. There were only three of us at the time, so I worked completely independently. This position gave me a lot of insight into start-up life.</p>

				<p>I was responsible for designing and implementing simulation software for video processing systems. The work was independent, so I taught myself a lot about video codec algorithms in order to be effective on my own.</p>

			<h3>Additional Information</h3>
			<section id="tavel_experience">
				<h4>Travel Experience</h4>
				<p>Solo travel (especially backpacking) requires a lot of improvisation, resourcefulness, quick decision-making, and social awareness. These are valuable skills that I've picked-up on the road. More than anything, the ability to make and commit to decisions is something that I value. Rather than overthinking things, I prefer to try things, make mistakes, learn, and iterate quickly. No second-guessing; no holding back.</p>
			</section>
			<section id="music">
				<h4>Music</h4>
				<p>Shortly after I started traveling, I decided to buy a guitar and learn music. I am mostly self-taught, with the greatly-appreciated help of many friends that I met on the road. I applied my passion for learning and self-improvement to this goal, and I'm very pleased with my progress. I love to play folk music, and have started writing and performing for anyone who will listen.</p>
			</section>
			<section id="hospitality">
				<h4>Hospitality</h4>
				<p>I spent 3 months working at a hostel/bar on a remote, tropical island. I hope that sounds as cool as it felt. I was responsible for serving food to guests, and getting people checked-in. Most of all, I did my best to maintain a very friendly atmosphere. I learned to make fast friends with all sorts of people who were usually only there for a couple of days.</p>
