		<section id="introduction">
			<p>Hello there, welcome! I'm Nathan. This page is about me.</p>
			<p>Professionally, I am a mathematician with several years of software development experience. I have a bachelor's degree in computer science from a prestigious, Canadian university. I have worked in start-ups as well as larger companies, worked independently and in teams, and have been responsible for client-facing projects.</p>
			<p>More personally, I am an ever-curious explorer who is always seeking to better himself. I took a hiatus from IT nearly 2 years ago to explore the world and hopefully learn how to live better. I am now a self-taught musician, and backpacker. I love strategy games, film, and cooking.</p>
			<p>Now, I'm looking for development work again. Perhaps you're here to see if I can help you with a project, or fill a role on your team. I believe that I can, and I hope to convince you likewise.</p>
			<p>Please feel free to contact me for more details, stories, or board games.</p>

				<p>I worked with some very talented people towards building the best indoor navigation experience around. We ran a small, agile team, working primarily independently. I was responsible for building our interactive map interfaces, which used web technology in a modified browser environment. I participated in back-end and mobile development as well. I also built internal tools that helped us reuse more of our code.</p>

				<p>I was part of a small team that was committed to doing SCRUM and pair programming right. We used a lot of different tools, but I mostly worked with Ruby on Rails.</p>

				<p>I was able to help the founders get the initial product going. I used web-scraping techniques (in Ruby) to build a large collection of academics and experts. There were only three of us at the time, so I had to complete tasks completely independently. This gave me a lot of insight into early start-up life.</p>

				<p>I was responsible for designing and implementing simulation software for video processing systems. This was object-oriented C++ programming using the SystemC framework. The work was independent, so I taught myself a lot about video codec algorithms in order to be effective on my own.</p>

				<p>Honours Computer Science, Co-operative Program, Faculty of Mathematics</p>
				<p>My program gave me the opportunity to write operating systems, mobile apps, 3D renderers, and more. I am most pleased with the language interpreters (lambda calc, SystemF, Prolog) I wrote in my fourth year.</p>

			<h3>Additional Information</h3>
			<section id="tavel_experience">
				<h4>Travel Experience</h4>
				<p>Solo travel (especially backpacking) requires a lot of improvisation, resourcefulness, quick decision-making, and social awareness. These are valuable skills that I've picked-up on the road. More than anything, the ability to make and commit to decisions is something that I value. Rather than overthinking things, I prefer to try things, make mistakes, learn, and iterate quickly. No second-guessing; no holding back.</p>
			</section>
			<section id="music">
				<h4>Music</h4>
				<p>Shortly after I started travelling, I decided to buy a guitar and learn music. I am mostly self-taught, with the greatly-appreciated help of many friends that I met on the road. I applied my passion for learning and self-improvement to this goal, and I'm very pleased with my progress. I love to play folk music, and have started writing and performing for anyone who will listen.</p>
			</section>
			<section id="hospitality">
				<h4>Hospitality</h4>
				<p>I spent 3 months working at a hostel/bar on a remote, tropical island. I hope that sounds as cool as it felt. I was responsible for serving food to guests, and getting people checked-in. Most of all, I did my best to maintain a very friendly atmosphere. I learned to make fast friends with all sorts of people who were usually only there for a couple of days.</p>
