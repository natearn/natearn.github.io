			<h3>About Me</h3>
			<p>I am a software developer who is passionate about creative problem solving and collaboration. I have over 3 years of professional experience, working mostly in agile environments with rapid release cycles. I have a wide variety of experience, but strongly believe that my most valuable skill is the ability to pick-up new ones.</p>

				<p>I worked with some very talented people towards building the best indoor navigation experience around. We ran a small, agile team, working primarily independently. I was responsible for building our interactive map interfaces, which used web technology in a modified browser environment. I participated in back-end and mobile development as well. I also built internal tools that helped us reuse more of our code.</p>

				<p>I was part of a small team that was committed to doing SCRUM and pair programming right. We used a lot of different tools, but I mostly worked with Ruby on Rails.</p>

				<p>I was able to help the founders get the initial product going. I used web-scraping techniques (in Ruby) to build a large collection of academics and experts. There were only three of us at the time, so I had to complete tasks completely independently. This gave me a lot of insight into early start-up life.</p>

				<p>I was responsible for designing and implementing simulation software for video processing systems. This was object-oriented C++ programming using the SystemC framework. The work was independent, so I taught myself a lot about video codec algorithms in order to be effective on my own.</p>
