			<h3>Active Projects</h3>
			<p>After many months of being without consistent internet or a usable computer, I am happy to say I can finally return to the world of software development. This section is going to list projects that I am actively working on or participating in. I'm just not sure what qualifies; I guess there has to be some concrete result for it to count. I'd like to focus on community efforts, as I've spent more than enough time in a corner, by myself (metaphorically).</p>
