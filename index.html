		<section id="introduction">
			<p>Hello there, welcome! I'm Nathan. This page is about me.</p>
			<p>I am a functional programming enthusiast with 2+ years of web development experience. I have a bachelor's degree in computer science. I am experienced with agile development processes. I have had sole responsibility for client-facing projects.</p>
			<p>More personally, I am an ever-curious explorer who is always seeking to better himself. I took a hiatus from IT nearly 2 years ago to explore the world and hopefully learn how to live better. I am now a self-taught musician, and backpacker. I love strategy games, film, and cooking.</p>
			<p>I am currently looking for software work either remotely or in Berlin.</p>

				<p>I was responsible for creating the indoor map interfaces (client-side browser app). A big challenge we faced was offline data availability, where we used a combination of solutions including local storage and cache headers. I facilitated the transition of our maps platform to Reactjs and contributed to other internal tools with the purpose of improving reliability and reusability of code.</p>

				<p>I was able to help the founders develop their initial product. My role was to write web-scraping scripts to build a large database of academics and experts. There were only three of us at the time, so I worked completely independently. This position gave me a lot of insight into start-up life.</p>

				<p>I was responsible for designing and implementing simulation software for video processing systems. The work was independent, so I taught myself a lot about video codec algorithms in order to be effective on my own.</p>
